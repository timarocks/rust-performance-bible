## Playlist Technical Notes

### BPM Flow
- Maintains 140-150 BPM throughout (with Enter Shikari burst at 160)
- Smooth transitions between breakdown sections
- Synchronized double-bass patterns for typing rhythm

### Key Compatibility
- Primarily Drop C/C#/D tunings
- Modal interchange between D minor and D# minor
- Strategic use of breakdowns for key transitions

### Coding Synchronization
- Breakdowns = Major refactoring moments
- Clean vocals = Reading documentation
- Screams = Debugging sessions
- Electronic sections = Benchmark runs
- Blast beats = Rapid implementation

## Usage Instructions

1. **Pre-coding Ritual**: Start playlist, crack knuckles, `cargo new --lib`
2. **The Rule of Crab**: One breakdown = one optimization
3. **Emergency Protocol**: If code still slow during "Smokahontas," start playlist again
4. **Victory Condition**: Achieve target performance before playlist ends
